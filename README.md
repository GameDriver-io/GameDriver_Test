# GameDriver Test

This project is intended to demonstrate the structure and usage of a GameDriver NUnit test for Unity.
This template can be used for testing against the editor or a standelone build, and can be modified to include additional tests - simply add the test attribute:

```
[Test]
public void AnotherTest()
{
  // Do some more testing
}
```

Additional documentation can be found at on the [GameDriver Support](https://support.gamedriver.io) website.

Contributions are encouraged, and appreciated.
