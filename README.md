# GameDriver Test

This project is intended to demonstrate the structure and usage of a GameDriver NUnit test for Unity. The project includes a Sample .NET 4.7.x project in Visual Studio with the NUnit 3 Test Adapter, Console Runner, and requires the latest version of the GameDriver API client which can be found at GameDriver.io/download

This template can be used for testing against the editor or a standelone build, and can be modified to include additional tests - simply add the test attribute:

```
[Test]
public void AnotherTest()
{
  // Do some more testing
}
```

Additional documentation can be found at on the [GameDriver Support](https://support.gamedriver.io) website.

Contributions are encouraged, and appreciated.
